"""
Python implementation of common model fitting operations to
analyse protein folding data. Simply automates some fitting
and value calculation. Will be extended to include phi-value
analysis and other common calculations.

Allows for quick model evaluation and plotting.

Also tried to make this somewhat abstract and modular to
enable more interesting calculations, such as Ising models
and such.

Requirements (recommended python 2.7+):
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - matplotlib
